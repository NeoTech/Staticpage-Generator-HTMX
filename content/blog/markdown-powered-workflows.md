# Markdown-Powered Workflows

Markdown is more than a formatting syntax — it's a workflow tool. When your content lives in `.md` files with structured frontmatter, you unlock powerful automation and collaboration patterns.

## Frontmatter as Metadata

Every markdown file in this project carries YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Post
Short-URI: my-post
Type: post
Category: Tutorials
Labels:
  - htmx
  - beginner
Parent: blog
Order: 1
Author: Jane Developer
Date: 2026-02-01
Description: A short summary for SEO and previews
Keywords:
  - htmx
  - tutorial
---
```

This frontmatter drives the entire site:

- **Navigation** is auto-generated from `Parent` and `Order` fields
- **Category indexes** group posts by `Category`
- **Label clouds** aggregate all `Labels` across posts
- **Breadcrumbs** follow the `Parent` hierarchy
- **SEO** uses `Description` and `Keywords`

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Draft → Review → Publish

Use a simple naming convention or frontmatter flag:

```yaml
---
title: Work in Progress
Status: draft       # Not built until changed to "published"
---
```

Your build script can filter by status, keeping drafts out of production.

### 2. Content Calendar

Since every post has a `Date` field, you can generate a content calendar from your markdown files:

```
2026-02-01  Getting Started with HTMX        (Tutorials)
2026-01-28  Tailwind Component Patterns       (Tutorials)
2026-01-20  Static Sites Are Back             (Deep Dives)
2026-01-15  Markdown-Powered Workflows        (Tips & Tricks)
```

### 3. Multi-Author Attribution

The `Author` field supports attribution without a database:

- Each post credits its author
- You could generate author pages by grouping posts by `Author`
- Author bios live in their own markdown files

### 4. Cross-Referencing with Short-URIs

The `Short-URI` field gives each page a stable, human-readable identifier. Use it for internal linking that survives file renames:

```markdown
Check out the [HTMX tutorial](/getting-started-htmx) for a hands-on introduction.
```

## Labels vs Categories

This project distinguishes between **categories** and **labels**:

| Aspect     | Category              | Labels                     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Cardinality| One per page          | Many per page              |
| Purpose    | Primary classification| Tags, topics, themes       |
| Hierarchy  | Top-level grouping    | Flat cross-cutting concerns|
| Example    | "Tutorials"           | "htmx", "beginner", "css" |

Categories answer *"What kind of content is this?"*  
Labels answer *"What topics does it touch?"*

## Automating with the Build

Because all metadata is machine-readable YAML, the build system can:

1. **Generate index pages** — One page per category, listing all matching posts
2. **Build label clouds** — Show all labels with post counts
3. **Create RSS feeds** — Pull title, date, description, and content from each post
4. **Validate structure** — Ensure every post has required fields
5. **Sort and paginate** — Order by date, group by category, paginate long lists

## Takeaway

Markdown + frontmatter gives you a lightweight CMS that lives in your git repo. No database, no admin panel, no vendor lock-in — just files you can read, diff, and version control.

> **Keep it simple.** If a spreadsheet can describe your content model, markdown can power it.
